# Classification - Important Points
- In statistics, ***Classification*** is the problem of identifying to which of a set of **categories** (sub-populations) a **new observation** belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing **observations** (or instances) whose category membership is known.
- In Simple,  ***Classification*** refers to a **predictive** modeling problem where a **class label** is predicted for a given example of input data.
- In the terminology of machine learning, **classification** is considered an instance of ***supervised learning***, i.e., learning where a training set of correctly identified observations is available. 
- The corresponding ***unsupervised*** procedure is known as **clustering**, and involves grouping data into categories based on some measure of **inherent** similarity or **distance**.
- We can use Classification algorithms in 4 ways.
  - Binary Classification
  - Multi-Class Classification
  - Multi-Label Classification
  - Imbalanced Classification

### Assumptions:
- **TODO**: Need to check for Assumptions on Classification problem.


## Linear Classifiers:

### 1. Binary Classification:
- ***Binary classification*** refers to those classification tasks that have two class labels.
- In Simple, Classification is a process of categorizing a given set of data into classes, It can be performed on both structured or unstructured data.
- Typically, binary classification tasks involve one class that is the normal state and another class that is the abnormal state.
- It is common to model a **binary** classification task with a model that predicts a ***Bernoulli probability distribution*** for each example.
- Popular Algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - k-Nearest Neighbors
  - Decision Trees
  - Support Vector Machine


### 2. Multi-Class Classification:
- Multi-class classification refers to those classification tasks that have more than two class labels.
