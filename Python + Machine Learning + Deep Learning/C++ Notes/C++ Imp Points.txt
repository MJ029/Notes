Basic Input/Output:
	- C++ I/O operation is using the stream concept. Stream is the sequence of bytes or flow of data. It makes the performance fast.
	- If bytes flow from main memory to device like printer, display screen, or a network connection, etc, this is called as output operation.
	- If bytes flow from device like printer, display screen, or a network connection, etc to main memory, this is called as input operation.

- I/O Library Header Files:
	<iostream>	--> It is used to define the cout, cin and cerr objects, which correspond to standard output stream, standard input stream and standard error stream, respectively.
	<iomanip>	--> It is used to declare services useful for performing formatted I/O, such as setprecision and setw.
	<fstream>	--> It is used to declare services for user-controlled file processing.

- Standard output stream (cout):
	- The cout is a predefined object of ostream class.
	- It is connected with the standard output device, which is usually a display screen.
	- The cout is used in conjunction with stream insertion operator (<<) to display the output on a console
	Ex:
		#include <iostream>  
		using namespace std;  
		int main( ) {  
		   char ary[] = "Welcome to C++ tutorial";  
		   cout << "Value of ary is: " << ary << endl;  
		}  

- Standard input stream (cin):
	- The cin is a predefined object of istream class.
	- It is connected with the standard input device, which is usually a keyboard.
	- The cin is used in conjunction with stream extraction operator (>>) to read the input from a console.
	Ex:
		#include <iostream>  
		using namespace std;  
		int main( ) {  
		  int age;  
		   cout << "Enter your age: ";  
		   cin >> age;  
		   cout << "Your age is: " << age << endl;  
		}

- Standard end line (endl):
	- The endl is a predefined object of ostream class.
	- It is used to insert a new line characters and flushes the stream.
	Ex:
		#include <iostream>  
		using namespace std;  
		int main( ) {  
			cout << "C++ Tutorial";     
			cout << " Javatpoint"<<endl;   
			cout << "End of line"<<endl;   
		}
