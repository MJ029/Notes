- Basic Knowledge on Python.

### 1. Introduction
- Machine learning is a subset of data science that deals with predictive modeling. In other words, using data to create models that can predict unknown values.
- It works by identifying relationships between data values that describe characteristics of something (its features) and the value we want to predict (the label), and encapsulating these relationships in a model through a training process.

### 2. Explore data
- Data exploration and analysis is typically an iterative process, in which the data scientist takes a sample of data, and performs the following kinds of task to analyze it and test hypotheses
	- Clean data to handle errors, missing values, and other issues.
	- Apply statistical techniques to better understand the data, and how the sample might be expected to represent the real-world population of data, allowing for random variation.
	- Visualize data to determine relationships between variables, and in the case of a machine learning project, identify features that are potentially predictive of the label.
	- Derive new features from existing ones that might better encapsulate relationships within the data.
	- Revise the hypothesis and repeat the process.
- Data scientists can use a variety of tools and techniques to explore, visualize, and manipulate data.
