### What is Machine Learning:
- Machine learning is a technique that uses mathematics and statistics to create a model that can predict unknown values.
- It is data driven approach.
- Ex:
	- A Cycle company that rents cycles in a city wants to predict daily rental demand. In-order to perform that you need below factors
		- one or more number of features(X)
		- predicted label (y)
		- Mathematical function f(x)
	- f(X) = y
	- In the above example the details about a given day (day of the week, weather, and so on) are the features (x).
	- The number of rentals for that day is the label (y)
	- Function f(X), predicts the number of rentals based on the information is encapsulated in a machine learning model.

Note:
- Training and deploying an effective machine learning model involves a lot of work, much of it time-consuming and resource-intensive. 
- But there are some readymade services available[such as AzureML-Service, Amazon Seagemager and etc...] in-ourder ro reduce the work load
