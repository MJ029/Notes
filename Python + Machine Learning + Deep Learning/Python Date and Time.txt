******************************************************************Python Date and Time***********************************************
- A Python program can handle date and time in several ways.
- Converting between date formats is a common chore for computers. 
- Python's time and calendar modules help track dates and times.
- Time intervals are floating-point numbers in units of seconds.
- Particular instants in time are expressed in seconds since 12:00am, January 1, 1970(epoch).
- There is a popular time module available in Python which provides functions for working with times, and for converting between representations.
- The function time.time() returns the current system time in ticks since 12:00am, January 1, 1970(epoch).
- Ex:
	import time;  # This is required to include time module.
	ticks = time.time()
	print "Number of ticks since 12:00am, January 1, 1970:", ticks
- What is TimeTuple?
	attribute		Index	Field					Values
	tm_year			0		4-digit year			2008
	tm_mon			1		Month					1 to 12
	tm_mday			2		Day						1 to 31
	tm_hour			3		Hour					0 to 23
	tm_min			4		Minute					0 to 59
	tm_sec			5		Second					0 to 61 (60 or 61 are leap-seconds)
	tm_wday			6		Day of Week				0 to 6 (0 is Monday)
	tm_yday			7		Day of year				1 to 366 (Julian day)
	tm_isdst		8		Daylight savings		-1, 0, 1, -1 means library determines DST
- Getting current time:
	import time;
	localtime = time.localtime(time.time())
	print "Local current time :", localtime
- Getting formatted time:
	import time;
	localtime = time.asctime( time.localtime(time.time()) )
	print "Local current time :", localtime
- Getting calendar for a month
	import calendar
	cal = calendar.month(2008, 1)
	print "Here is the calendar:"
	print cal
