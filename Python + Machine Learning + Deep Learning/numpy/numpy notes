Introduction
- NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant.
- It stands for Numerical Python.
- It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object at the core of the NumPy package[ndarray object].
- This encapsulates n-dimensional arrays of homogeneous datatypes.
- Numpy offers comprehensive mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and more.
- Numpy is Platform independent and interoperable library[supports wide range of Hardware & computing platforms.]
- Numpy array are 50x faster[core of NumPy is well-optimized C code] than traditional Python sequences.
- NumPyâ€™s high level syntax makes it accessible and productive for programmers from any background or experience level.
- 

Points to Remember:
- Numpy arrays are fixed size at creation[Changing the size of an ndarray will create a new array and delete the original.], unlike python lists[which can grow dynamically].
- The elements in a NumPy array are all required to be homogeneous datatypes[same data types].
- NumPy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations on large numbers of data.
