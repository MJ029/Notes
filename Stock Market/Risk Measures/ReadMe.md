# 2.Stock Market Risk Measures
- Risk measures are statistical measures that are historical predictors of investment risk and volatility, and they are also major components in modern portfolio theory (MPT). 
- MPT is a standard financial and academic methodology for assessing the performance of a stock or a stock fund as compared to its benchmark index. 
- Risk measures can be used individually or together to perform a risk assessment.
- There are five principal risk measures, and each measure provides a unique way to assess the risk present in investments that are under consideration. 
	- Alpha
	- Beta
	- R-Squared
	- Standard Deviation [SD]
	- Sharpe Ratio

### 2.4 SD - Standard Deviation
- Statistically, SD measures the **dispresion** [or] **variety** [or] **variability** of data from its expected value.
- As it relates to investments, the standard deviation measures how much return on investment is deviating from the expected normal or average returns.
- Ex: A stock with higher SD indicates [or] experiences higher volatility, therefore higher values of risk associated with it.
- Higher SD = Higher volatility
