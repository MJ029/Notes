### 1.Introduction
- ***P/E Ratio*** (or) ***Price-To-Earnings*** Ratio is used for valuating *current share price* [Price Per Share] of a company relative to its *earnings per share* [EPS].
- It is also know as *Price Multiple* (or) *Earnings Multiple*.
- It helps the **investors** & **Analysts** to determine the relative value of a company shares.
- The P/E ratio helps us determine whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. 
- A company's P/E can also be benchmarked against other stocks in the same industry or against the broader market, such as the `Nifty50` Index.

:exclamation: **Warning:** 
> - Companies that have no earnings or that are losing money do not have a P/E ratio.
> - When people refer to the P/E ratio generically, they are typically referring to the trailing P/E.

:point_right: **Note:**
> - P/E ratio holds the most value to an analyst when compared against similar companies in the same industry or for a single company across a period of time.  
> - Sometimes, analysts are interested in long-term valuation trends and consider the P/E 10 or P/E 30 measures, which average the past 10 or past 30 years of earnings, respectively. 

### 2.Formula
- To determine P/E ratio, we must simply divide the current stock price by the earnings per share (EPS)

$$P/E = { Market \ \ Value \ \ Per \ \ Share \ \ (P) \over Earnings \ \ Per \ \ Share \ \ (E)}$$

$P- Stock \ \ Price \ \ of \ \ the \ \ day$

### 3.Types
- Generally we can use two different types of PE ratio in realtime as shown below.
  - Trailing 
  - Forward

:point_right: **Note**:
> A third and less common variation uses the sum of the last two actual quarters and the estimates of the next two quarters.

#### 3.1 Forward P/E Ratio
- Forward price-to-earnings (forward P/E) is a version of PE ratio that uses forecasted earnings [which can be found from *future earnings guidance* in financial results] for the P/E calculation, Sometimes called "estimated price to earnings".
- While the earnings used in this formula are just an estimate and not as reliable as current or historical earnings data, there are still benefits to estimated P/E analysis.

$$Forward \ \ P/E = { Current \ \ Share \ \ Price \ \ (P) \over Estimated \ \ Future \ \ Earnings \ \ Per \ \ Share \ \ (E)}$$

:exclamation: **Warning:** 
> - Because forward P/E uses estimated earnings per share (EPS), it may produce incorrect or biased results if actual earnings prove to be different.
> - Analysts often combine forward and trailing P/E estimates to make a better judgment.
> - There are inherent problems with the forward P/E metricâ€”namely, companies could underestimate (or) overestimate earnings.

##### 3.1.1 Limitations
- Since forward P/E relies on estimated future earnings, it is subject to miscalculation and/or analysts' bias.
- Companies could underestimate earnings to beat the consensus estimate P/E when the next quarter's earnings are announced.
- Other companies may overstate the estimate and later adjust it going into their next earnings announcement.
- Furthermore, external analysts may also provide estimates, which may diverge from the company estimates, creating confusion.

#### 3.2 Trailing P/E
- Trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) is a relative valuation multiple that is based on the last 12 months of actual earnings. 
- It is calculated by taking the current stock price and dividing it by the trailing earnings per share (EPS) for the past 12 months.
- It is considered a useful indicator to standardize and compare relative share price between time periods and among companies.
- Trailing P/E, though widespread in use, is limited in that past earnings may not accurately reflect the current or future earnings situation of the company.

$$Trailing \ \ P/E = { Current \ \ Share \ \ Price \ \ (P) \over Trailing \ \ 12 \ \ Months \ \ EPS \ \ (E)}$$

#### 3.3 Difference between Forward & Trailing P/E
| Forward P/E | Trailing P/E |
|------------|-------------|
| It uses Projected EPS | It uses total EPS earnings of last 12 months. |
| It is least popular since it is subjective [forcasted not actual] | It is most popular since it is most objective [historic actuals] |
| Investors does not prefer to look forward PE because it is estimated earnings | Investors does prefer this because this is Actual Earnings for last 12 months. |

### 4. Why do we use P/E ratio ?
- it creates as simple apple-to-apple evaluation of relative earnings.
- The P/E ratio can thus be used to look for relative bargains in the market or to determine when a stock is too expensive compared to others.

:exclamation: **Warning:** 
> - A disadvantage of the P/E ratio is that stock prices are constantly moving, while earnings remain fixed. Analysts attempt to deal with this issue by using the trailing price-to-earnings ratio, which uses earnings from the most recent four quarters rather than earnings from the end of the last fiscal year.
