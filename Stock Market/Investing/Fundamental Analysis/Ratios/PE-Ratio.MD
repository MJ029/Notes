### 1.Introduction
- ***P/E Ratio*** (or) ***Price-To-Earnings*** Ratio is used for valuating *current share price* [Price Per Share] of a company relative to its *earnings per share* [EPS].
- It is also know as *Price Multiple* (or) *Earnings Multiple*.
- It helps the **investors** & **Analysts** to determine the relative value of a company shares.
- The P/E ratio helps us determine whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. 
- A company's P/E can also be benchmarked against other stocks in the same industry or against the broader market, such as the `Nifty50` Index.

> - Companies that have no earnings or that are losing money do not have a P/E ratio.
> - P/E ratio holds the most value to an analyst when compared against similar companies in the same industry or for a single company across a period of time.  
> - Sometimes, analysts are interested in long-term valuation trends and consider the P/E 10 or P/E 30 measures, which average the past 10 or past 30 years of earnings, respectively. 

### 2.Formula
- To determine P/E ratio, we must simply divide the current stock price by the earnings per share (EPS)

$$P/E = { Market \ \ Value \ \ Per \ \ Share \ \ (P) \over Earnings \ \ Per \ \ Share \ \ (E)}$$

$P- Stock \ \ Price \ \ of \ \ the \ \ day$

### 3.Types
