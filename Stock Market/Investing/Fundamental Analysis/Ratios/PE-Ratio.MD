### 1.Introduction
- ***P/E Ratio*** (or) ***Price-To-Earnings*** Ratio is used for valuating *current share price* [Price Per Share] of a company relative to its *earnings per share* [EPS].
- It is also know as *Price Multiple* (or) *Earnings Multiple*.
- It helps the **investors** & **Analysts** to determine the relative value of a company shares.
