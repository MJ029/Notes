************************************Classification Analysis Important points************************************
Hint:
	- Random Forest and Gradient Boosting ensemble methods can be used for Regression/Classification analysis.
	- “max_depth” hyperparameter in Gradient Boosting
		- Lower is better parameter in case of same validation accuracy
		- Increase the value of max_depth may underfit the data
	- Both algorithms(Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) can handle real valued attributes by discretizing them
	- Low bias machine learning algorithms - Decision Trees, k-NN and SVM
	- Hight bias machine learning algorithms - Liear Regression, Logistic Regression

How to calculate accuracy, precision, recall using confusion matrix ?
	- Accuracy = (True Positive + True Negative) / Total Observations
	- Precision = (True positive) / (True Positive + False Positive)
	- Recall Rate = (True Positive) / (Total Positive + False Negative)

Explain the process of building Decision tree ?
- ID3:
	- Find Entropy of target variable
	- Find Entropy of each input attribute
	- Find information Gain of each input attribute
	- Consider the attribute with Highest Information gain(loweest Entropy value) as root element
	- devide dataset to branches
		- If entropy = 0 --> Leaf node
		- If entropy != 0 --> go to step 2 and repeat the same 
- C4.5:
	- find entropy of target variable
	- find information gain and split info of each input attribute
	- find gain raito of each input attribute
	- Consider the attribute with Highest Gain ratio as root element
	- devide dataset to branches
		- If Entropy = 0 --> Leaf Node
		- IF Entropy != 0 --> go to Step - 2 and repeat the same
		
- CART:
	- find Gini Index of each input attribute
	- Calculate Weighted Gini Index  of each input attribute
	- Consider the input attribute with loweest Gini index as root element
	- devide the dataset into sub branches
		- If Gini = 0 --> Leaf node
		- If Gini != 0 --> go to step 2 and repeat the same

You are given a dataset on cancer detection. You have built a classification model and achieved an accuracy of 96 percent. Why shouldn't you be happy with your model performance? What can you do about it?
	- Cancer detection results in imbalanced data. In an imbalanced dataset, accuracy should not be based as a measure of performance.
	- It is important to focus on the remaining four percent, which represents the patients who were wrongly diagnosed.
	- Early diagnosis is crucial when it comes to cancer detection, and can greatly improve a patient’s prognosis.
	- Hence, to evaluate model performance, we should use
		- Sensitivity (True Positive Rate), Specificity (True Negative Rate), F measure to determine the class wise performance of the classifier.
		
What is Baaging Tree ?
	- In bagging trees, individual trees are independent of each other
	- Bagging is the method for improving the performance by aggregating the results of weak learners
	
What is Boosting tree ?
	- In boosting trees, individual weak learners are independent of each other
	- Its the method for improving the performance by aggregating the results of weak learners

Why is naive Bayes so ‘naive’ ?
	- naive Bayes is so ‘naive’ because it assumes that all of the features in a data set are equally important and independent. 
	- As we know, these assumption are rarely true in real world scenario.
