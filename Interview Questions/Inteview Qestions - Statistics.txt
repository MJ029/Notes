************************************Statistics Important points************************************
Hints:
	- We use the elbow method to select k for k-means clustering.
	- We can use K-NN (k-nearest neighbor), for inputting missing values of both categorical and continuous variablesWhat is the significance of p-value?
	- When P <= 0.05
		This indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis; so you reject the null hypothesis.
	- Whn P >= 0.05
		This indicates weak evidence against the null hypothesis, so you accept the null hypothesis. 
	- When P = 0.05
		This is considered to be marginal, meaning it could go either way.
		
What is F-test ?
	- The F-test is designed to test if two population variances are equal.
	- It does this by comparing the ratio of two variances.
	- So, if the variances are equal, the ratio of the variances will be 1. 
	- If the null hypothesis is true, then the F test-statistic given above can be simplified 
	
Difference between F-Test and T-test ?
	- t-test is used to test if two sample have the same mean. 
	- The assumptions are that they are samples from normal distribution.
	- f-test is used to test if two sample have the same variance.
	
What is the goal of A/B Testing?
	- This is statistical hypothesis testing for randomized experiments with two variables, A and B. 
	- The objective of A/B testing is to detect any changes to a web page to maximize or increase the outcome of a strategy.
	
What are the confounding variables?
	- These are extraneous variables in a statistical model that correlates directly or inversely with both the dependent and the independent variable.
	- The estimate fails to account for the confounding factor.
	
What are eigenvalue and eigenvector?
	- Eigenvalues are the directions along which a particular linear transformation acts by flipping, compressing, or stretching.
	- Eigenvectors are for understanding linear transformations.
	- In data analysis, we usually calculate the eigenvectors for a correlation or covariance matrix. 
	
What are the types of biases that can occur during sampling?
	- Selection bias
	- Undercoverage bias
	- Survivorship bias
	
What is selection bias?
	- Selection bias, in general, is a problematic situation in which error is introduced due to a non-random population sample.
	
What is survivorship bias?
	- Survivorship bias is the logical error of focusing aspects that support surviving a process and casually overlooking those that did not because of their lack of prominence. 
	- This can lead to wrong conclusions in numerous ways.
		
How can a time-series data be declared as stationary?
	- It is stationary when the variance and mean of the series are constant with time. 
	
Which of the following machine learning algorithms can be used for inputting missing values of both categorical and continuous variables?
	- The K nearest neighbor algorithm can be used because it can compute the nearest neighbor and if it doesn't have a value, it just computes the nearest neighbor based on all the other features. 
	- When you're dealing with K-means clustering or linear regression, you need to do that in your pre-processing, otherwise, they'll crash. Decision trees also have the same problem, although there is some variance. 
	
Explain cross-validation ?
	- Cross-validation is a model validation technique for evaluating how the outcomes of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set.
	- It is mainly used in backgrounds where the objective is to forecast and one wants to estimate how accurately a model will accomplish in practice. 
	- The goal of cross-validation is to term a data set to test the model in the training phase to limit problems like overfitting and gain insight into how the model will generalize to an independent data set.

What is collaborative filtering?
	- Most recommender systems use this filtering process to find patterns and information by collaborating perspectives, numerous data sources, and several agents.
	
What is Boosting tree ?
	- In boosting trees, individual weak learners are independent of each other
	- Its the method for improving the performance by aggregating the results of weak learners
